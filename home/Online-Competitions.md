# Battalion Wars Online Competitions

*An initiative by LGG and FanBattalion*

The Battalion Wars community never stops growing, and more and more projects and ideas make this community ever so active. One of the main sources of community growth is **multiplayer**. The competitions that have been organized so far have allowed the community to gather around the same event, as well as introducing this fantastic game and its fun multiplayer mode to many people.

Because of our ambition and our desire to see the community grow relentlessly, we want to propose a calendar of competitions throughout the year, with rewards, titles and ceremonies at the end of each competition and each year to bring even more life to the community : the BATTALION WARS ONLINE COMPETITIONS

## Main Rules

#### Basic Rules

-   Players must join the **Battalion Wars Discord** server.
-   Participants must have an online connection:
    -   **PC players**: Zwei **+** Wimmfi
    -   **Wii players**: Wimmfi only
-   All multiplayer missions must be unlocked.
-   **Mods** or **cheats** are forbidden.
-   Maps are chosen randomly by the server bot.
-   While a competition is live, participants receive the `@Tournament Participant` role.
-   After each match, participants must report to organizers:
    -   Number of victories and defeats
    -   Maps played
    -   In **Assault**: attacker/defender wins
    -   In **Skirmish**: nation used

#### Recommendations

-   For help with Zwei or Wimmfi connections, contact **LGG**.
-   Join `@Multiplayer (BW2)` for pickup matches.
-   Keep a consistent Discord name; if you change it, notify organizers so archives stay accurate.
-   Recording battles is encouraged but not mandatory.
-   Streaming to YouTube/Twitch is highly encouraged.

#### Map Rules

-   **Armada**: Do **not** attack land structures during “Sea Forts.”
-   **Sand Castles**: Air base capture is disallowed.
-   **Battlestations**: Do **not** disturb enemy infantry capturing your factory until both factories are capped.

#### The “Quick Change”

Switching units grants a brief protective layer. **Conscious use** is dishonorable if it is:

1.  Constant across battles
2.  Excessive within a single map
3.  Decisive (used with key units in strategic spots)

#### The “Spawn Kill” (Skirmish only)

Trapping an opponent in their spawn area is dishonorable.

#### “Camping at the Spawn Base” (Skirmish only)

Hiding in the risk zone near spawn is dishonorable.

#### Surrender

If you surrender, notify the organizers immediately; your opponent is awarded the win.

#### Player Expulsion

Rule violations or extended inactivity may result in expulsion from the competition.

#### Abandon

A player may abandon by notifying organizers:

-   Remaining matches against other opponents are counted as **auto‑wins** for those opponents.
-   Statistics from matches already played remain valid.

#### Controversies

1.  Players first attempt to resolve issues by discussion.
2.  Options include replaying the match or accepting the result.
3.  If unresolved, escalate to the organizers.
4.  Submit facts, opinions, evidence, and a proposed solution.
5.  Organizers issue a **Provisional Decision**.
6.  Appeals are allowed for 2 days; thereafter a **Definitive Decision** is final.

#### Pending Battles (League mode)

-   If **both** players are at fault: 0–0 (no points awarded).
-   If **one** player is at fault: opponent receives 3 points per unplayed match.
-   If both made good‑faith attempts but one was more proactive: that player earns 1 point per match.

#### Connection Issues

-   **Pre‑match** failures to join Zwei/Wimmfi:
    -   If not fixed before half the competition window, treated as an **abandon**.
-   **Chronic failures** (two failed attempts): remaining matches count as wins for the opponent.
-   **In‑match** disconnects:
    -   Distinguish genuine network drops from other issues.
    -   Lost connection → replay the same map and nations.
    -   Suspicious repeated drops → escalate to organizers.

#### Preference Order

When players are tied on points:

1.  The player with **more battles played** ranks higher.
2.  If still tied, they **share the position** (unless the tie affects advancement to the next phase).
