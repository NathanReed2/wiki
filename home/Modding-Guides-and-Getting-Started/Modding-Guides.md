# Music and Sounds

We know Battalion Wars soundtrack is awesome! But what if I told you you can use any custom music throughout the whole mission or in a specific section of a mission.

## How to change a level’s music

**Tools needed:**

- [DSP Audacity](https://github.com/jackoalan/audacity/releases/tag/v2.3.0)
