Now that you have an **"Extracted"** version of the game you want to mod.

# Step 2: BW Level Editor

You're going to want to download the latest version of the [BW Level Editor](https://github.com/RenolY2/battalion-level-editor/releases).

# Step 3: Loading Levels

After you downloaded the **BW Level Editor**, navigate to the **CompoundFiles** directory and select the correct **.xml** for the level you want to start editing.

# Step 4: Editing Levels

Now that you selected a level, you should have loaded into the said level you picked. Now you can start messing around, just know that it's a good idea to watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rTJXwBleuU) explaining what's in the **BW Level Editor** since the 1.0 release.
